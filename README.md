# Handmade _SDL_

_Handmade SDL_ is a humble game engine framework designed as a teaching tool, with the added benefit of creating graphical applications and games. With it, you can make a simple 2D game while learning intermediate and advanced C++ concepts. The engine allows you to develop small sprite-based games, with the ability to add in 2D animations, integrate audio, display text and handle basic collisions.
